				<h3>About</h3>

				<p>
					Hello, I'm Joshua Bultsma and I am currently in the C#/.NET After Hours bootcamp @ Grand Circus.
				</p>
				<p>
					While working as an electrician i really found my self interested in the tech industry by looking at PLC Controllers and wondering
					how the brain behind all the wires worked.  I already knew i wanted to be a developer but I soon found an opportunity to move into
					the electrical engineering world designing health care power systems. This was a great opportunity to learn office culture in a technical 
					setting and getting hands on experience solving complex electrical problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently I am at Grand Circus learning everything from recursive methods to Objects/Classes & subclasses. I still have a way's to go 
					and so much to learn but I'm enjoying every minute of this bootcamp and can't wait to learn what will be taught in the coming months. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm extremely excited to start my career as a developer and I if you would be interested in reaching out to me you can find my info under the Portfolio page.
